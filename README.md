Embperl
========

Embperl is a framework for building websites with Perl.

This Github repository is a fork of the Embperl 2.5.0 source code from CPAN
with various fixes from the Debian project and the maillist.
This version should build with modern perl versions and Apache 2.4 and the
corresponding mod_perl 2.

Join the maillist https://perl.apache.org/maillist/embperl.html for questions.
Information on Embperl is found on the website https://perl.apache.org/embperl/

See the README and README.v2 files for more information.
Read the INSTALL.pod file for instructions how to build this software.
